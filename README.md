# api

Go web service that serves as a cache to APIs that each Chatterino client could use.

Emote data is served cached from [twitchemotes.com](https://twitchemotes.com/).

# Install

libvips is required for the image resizing
https://github.com/h2non/bimg#libvips

To support animated gifs (output webp) we need atleast version 8.8

Also install these for proper gif/webp support

`sudo apt install libwebp-dev libgif-dev`


## Routes
`/twitchemotes/set/:setID`  
returns information about a given twitch emote set. Example response:
```
{
    "channel_name": "forsen", // twitch user name
    "channel_id": "22484632", // twitch user id
    "type": "sub",            // string describing what type of emote set this is (e.g. "sub")
    "custom": false           // indicates whether this is added/modified by us or straight passthrough from the twitchemotes api
    "tier": 1,                // integer describing what tier the sub emote is part of
}
```

`link_resolver/:url`  
resolve a url into a preview tooltip. Example response:
```
{
    "status": 200,                     // status code returned from the page
    "message": "",                     // used to forward errors in case the website e.g. couldn't load
    "tooltip": "<div>tooltip</div>",   // HTML tooltip used in Chatterino
    "link": "http://final.url.com/asd" // final url, after any redirects
